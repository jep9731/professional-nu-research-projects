## 📁 Projects Overview

| Project | Title | Description |
|:-------:|:------|:------------|
| 1 | Project A: Comparing Hippocampal Freesurfer Segmentation Methodologies | Compares hippocampus segmentation methodologies in Freesurfer. |
| 2 | Project B: Clustering SuperAging Neuropsychological Testing (working title) | Placeholder for upcoming research project — topic and direction still in development. |

Each project contains:

* Source code and scripts.
* Dataset references or data folder.
* Result visualizations.
* A dedicated README.md for deeper details.

## 🧪 Project Details

**🧠 Project A — Hippocampal Segmentation Modalities** 

* Goal: Evaluate segmentation consistency across Freesurfer and ASHS tools
* Modalities compared:
    * T1-only
    * T2-only
    * T2 high-resolution (T2H)
    * T1 + T2
    * T1 + T2H
* Outputs: Volumetric comparisons, structural overlays, reliability metrics

**🧠 Project B — Clustering SuperAging Neuropsychological Testing** 

Future expansion — additional neuroimaging research planned.
